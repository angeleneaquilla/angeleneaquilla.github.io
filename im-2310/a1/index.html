            <h4>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>

            <p>
                The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with Mika Chernov and Sinjin Hawke's Liquid Entropy 
                project was the captivating visuals that emerged on my computer screen. The sound produced with the 3D 
                animation is distinct and intriguing. I noticed the light beams moving around the animation and that a 
                settings menu can be seen on the right top corner. At the top of the website are a range of other interesting 
                animations produced by the artist.

            <p>
                I spent most of the time in this experience adjusting the controls and moving the cursor to see the 
                differences that it makes and the effect it has on the screen.

            <h4>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>

            <p>
                The most common action in the two minute interaction with the experience was definitely exploring the control 
                adjustments and seeing what they do to the animation and sound.

            <h4>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>

            <p>
                The primary goal of this interactive experience is about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the 
                junction of sound and visual art. The artists wanted to explore new forms of creative expression and 
                challenge the conventional notions of what a record label looks like. The experience was designed to make the 
                user in control of the audio and visuals, and convey an experience that feels like a futuristic, otherworldly, 
                and completely unfamiliar universe. Ultimately, <em>Liquid Entropy</em> is designed for users to have fun and 
                approach it as a digital instrument.

        <section id="question6">
            <h4>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h4>

            <p>
                This interactive experience communicates the concept of challenging boundaries through its visual aesthetic 
                and how it is meant to be interacted by its users. 
                This project combines advanced software tools and methods to create futuristic and mesmerising motions 
                graphics and 3D animations that synchronise with their music and ultimately produce a unique audiovisual 
                experience. This goal was further achieved through the implementation of abstract imagery characterised by 
                elements of technology, nature, and even geometry. The implementation of light beams, mirror, and chrome 
                aesthetic attributes make the experience feel even more unearthly. By employing the user as a crucial 
                component in this experience and using their interaction with the different parameters in order to generate 
                sound makes the project notable for its unconventional and special approach to music and the digital media world.

        <section id="question7">
            <h4>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
            
            <p>
                I think that the experience should be interacted with by having the users just engage with the different 
                settings and examine what it does to the animation. However, the website ultimately does not have any 
                functionality other than being a fun interactive audiovisual experience and it will not receive the same 
                attention from previous users who have experienced it. Essentially, users should feel curious and experimentative
                while engaging with this project and view it as an art form and experience that they can always come back and visit
                over time; whether it is to observe the visuals or the sound that are produced.

        <section id="question8">
            <h4>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
            
            <p>
                The project communicates through sound and a limited amount of words shown in the form of control parameters.
                The website utilisation of suspenseful and repetitive sound suggests to me that it is meant for the user to 
                observe their emotions when interacting with the website. The controls imply that the user should feel 
                creatively open-minded and experimental with their interaction, and in a way, treat the experience like an instrument. 
            </p>

        <section id="question9">
            <h4>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
            
            <p>
                The visual scenery suggests post-apocalyptic themes and potentially references to video games of that nature 
                such as Fallout or Escape from Tarkov. The realistic visuals exhibit the inside of an abandoned building and 
                features grey and low lighting. Moreover, the controls on the upper right corner is a feature in most video 
                games with a control panel where one can adjust it and it will affect the user's interaction with the video 
                game.

            <p>
                The music in this experience references the Shepard Tone audio illusion, which is achieved by overlapping 
                notes that are one octave apart to create the feeling of continuous endless falling or rising. Hearing this 
                sound in the project reminds me of a scene in the movie Dunkirk, in which the film sound composer, Hans 
                Zimmer, utilised the Shepard Tone to build suspense in the intense scene.

            <h4>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>

            <p>
                The reference to video games suggests that I should be explorative and experimentative when engaging with the 
                website. It was designed for the user to engage with the controls and review the different outcomes visually 
                and sonically. Moreover, the utilisation of controls feature conveys that it can be treated like a visual and 
                musical instrument, in which adjusting the controls is like tuning a guitar or pulling different strings of
                an instrument.

            <h4>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
            
            <p>
                The reference suggests that I should feel creative when using the website. The controls ultimately resemble 
                the design tools in photo or video-editing apps, and therefore experimenting with those tools will result in 
                different visual outcomes. Moreover, it suggests that users should feel like they are in control because they 
                have authority over what will go on in the video. Furthermore, the post-apocalyptic visual in addition to the 
                Shepard Tone audio element implies that I should feel tense and on edge, because it feels like the suspense 
                is constantly building up and will eventually lead to something.

            <h4>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
            
            <p>
                The most frustrating element from this interaction is that it took multiple times for me to load the website 
                and interact with it to finally hear the audio. Thus, the usability is not the best as users such as a fan of 
                the artist who would go to the website to view the project in hopes of hearing a unified audiovisual 
                experience would have a negative experience with this particular site. Without the music, it makes it extremely
                harder for one to enjoy and understand the purpose of this website. Hence, it is very important to ensure that
                the music in this website is instantly heard the moment a user loads the site.  
            </p>

        <section id="question13">
            <h4>13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
            
            <p>
                The most satisfying aspect of this project was the visual design of this animation and how it just engages 
                the viewer through the control feature. The dynamic and fluid nature of the animation is very satisying to see
                and the music captivating the audience using the Shepard Tone effect is very unique and special in this project.
                It makes one completely immersed at the metallic liquid syncing to the audio and observant of their emotions 
                amidst the experience.
